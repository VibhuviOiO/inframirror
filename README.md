# Infra MIÐ¯ROR

## Developer Setup

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# (Optional) Initialize database and seed data
# npx prisma migrate dev
# npx prisma db seed
npm run start
```

## Production (Docker)

### Build and Run as Container
Docker image is published to GitHub Container Registry on every merge to the `release` branch.

#### Pull and Run
You can create the docker images required for the project or you can use the available docker image from the ghcr registry. 

##### PULL
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/vibhuvioio/inframirror:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/vibhuvioio/infragent:latest
```

##### Create the docker images
```bash
# on the home or root of the repo
docker build -t inframirror .

# infragent
cd infragent/
docker build -t infragent .
```

#### Using Docker Compose
By default it uses the location image creation process, replace them with ghcr  images or retag them to what docker-compose expects. 

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

## GitHub Actions
Docker image is automatically built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`) when changes are merged to the `release` branch. The image is public and can be pulled by anyone.

## Notes
- The frontend is built and served from the backend container's `/public` directory.
- Backend serves API at `/api` and static files for SPA frontend.
- Database initialization and seeding are optional for development.
